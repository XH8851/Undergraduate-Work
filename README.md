The 'Research' folder stores shareable scripts I wrote for my research on stock price with my friends. 
<br><br> As undergradute student researchers, we were responsible for the whole project from roadmap to deliverables, and, 
- conducted analysis of the validity of value strategies in China’s stock market
- extracted, organized and analyzed information of about 3,000 stocks over 20 years using R, SQL, Bloomberg and Wind
- applied Fisher optimal partition, cluster analysis, factor loading matrix, Sortino ratio and Carhart four-factor model using packages and self-defined function based on statistics

The 'thesis.do' is a shareable Stata script I wrote for my thesis on graduation. The thesis belongs to School of Management, Fudan University.

The code in the folder works on
- some data preprocessing
- single-group interrupted time series analysis (short term vs. long term)
- fixed effect

The other three folders and sql script build an alum internship recruitment information system for my academic use. Here, our team
